I am planning on making an installer in the future, but for now this works.

# Note 
Rockford is an ever-changing airport. This scenery will be outdated constantly as there is lag between satelitte images. I will do my best to update the airport whenever new imagery is available. I live very close to the airport, but I do not have the ability to go measure things myself, nor do I have access to blueprints.
